This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron Barrel weighing 500 pounds. The Barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks  a hatch at one end of the Barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

Armor Class: 20
Hit Points: 200
Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail arent extended)
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go Underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatuss levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as show in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.
